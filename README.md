## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about building impactful and scalable tech products across the web, mobile, and AI domains. I bring a blend of **strong fundamentals, leadership, and product thinking** to every project I work on.

- 💼 Currently at **Infocusp Innovations**, building generative AI applications and cloud-native systems.
- 🛠️ Worked on production-grade platforms using **React, Next.js, Node.js, FastAPI, and Ruby on Rails**.
- 🌐 Experienced with **cloud platforms** like AWS & GCP (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Firebase, BigQuery).
- 🧠 Interested in **Generative AI**, backend systems, and performance-driven frontend architecture.
- 🎙️ Conducted tech seminars and mentored peers—I'm always eager to share knowledge.
- 🎯 2025 Goals: Contribute more to open source, publish educational content, and explore Rust + WASM.
- 🎸 Fun fact: I love sketching and playing guitar or piano in my downtime!
